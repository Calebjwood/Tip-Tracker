# Tip Tracker

## Description

Tip Tracker provides a user an easy way to keep track of how much they make working a job in which they earn tips on top of an hourly wage. After theyâ€™ve made an account, they can add as many jobs to their account as they want and then for each job enter their hourly wage. They can then enter how many hours they worked, how many tips they made, and the date that they worked. This data is recorded and displayed along with a line graph showing fluctuations in total income for that job, providing the user with an easy-to-read visual representation of their income.
